# shortest-path-using-johnson-algorithm
Johnson's Algorithm uses both Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm. Johnson's Algorithm uses the technique of "reweighting." If all edge weights w in a graph G = (V, E) are nonnegative, we can find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices by running Dijkstra's Algorithm once from each vertex
